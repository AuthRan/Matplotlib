Why Matplotlib?
It is used for data visualization  
Hmare pass ek prob hai? -> without visualization tumhein mannually ek ek row ko scan karna pdega + time jata + effort jata wahi agr if you have data visualization chize samjhna thora asaan ho jata hai.
DV is a process of converting boring data(numbers, texts) into colourful, clear and pictures(bar graph, pie chart, diagrams)
" Pictures speak louder than numbers "

For interview, why Matplotlib -
    :Images are processed by brain 60k times faster.
    :Graphs pe it is easier to detect lie.
    :90% Big Data Fails -> They didn't explore data visually.
    :Miller's law : our brain can hold 7 pieces at once -> but if you use graphs then u can go upto thousands.


In early 2000, python was being used in Research and Automation but for plotting mostly Matlab was used but it was paid and has low level code. John D Hunter was a neurologist and creater of matplotlib
MAT - Matlab
PLOT - plotting
LIB - Library
Line graph(to find trend), Bar Charts(Diff groups ko compare), Pie Charts(parts of whole), Histogram(Frequency distribution), Scatter Plot(To find relationship btw two points) + You can add custom graphics, colour etc

We mostly do "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt" as pyplot gives us ready made stuff to work with plotting.
